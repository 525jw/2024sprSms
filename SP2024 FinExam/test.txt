we learned about how the shell program works with psh2.c 
But psh2.c is designed to accept arguments one by one in multiple lines.
Modify the psh2.c that we learned in the class to support the following features.

- The program name is psh3 The c code file name is psh3.c
- When we start psh3 shell, it should show a command prompt like regular shell. The command prompt should be '$'
ex) jw@local $./psh3
    $ <-psh3 is running here
- In the command prompt whe should be able to enter a command in a single line
- When "exit" is entere, it should quit and return to the original shell prompt.
- It should not print unecessary message on the sceen
